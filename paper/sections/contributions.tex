We wish to be graded equally since we believe
our contributions were equal. Evan Huang did part of the Graph CNN work for CS221. Due to the extensive computation time (about 4 hours per run) and need
for custom-coded random walk features discussed in CS224W, we want part of this analysis to count for CS224W as well since it took a considerable amount of time and resulted in the best accuracy after several iterations.
