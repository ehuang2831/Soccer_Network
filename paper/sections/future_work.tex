%We hope to expand our work to get better predictive and analytical results. We see some success with clustering, but want to try additional feature embeddings and clustering methods. One clustering task to be done is the clustering of individual node embeddings to determine player ``roles''. These roles within a network may lead to some predictive power regarding team performance. We can compare the impact of labeling network roles vs. given roles (striker, midfielder, goalkeeper, etc) within the dataset by running different predictive models on them.

%We also hope to implement our initial proposal ideas. That is, we want to use more complicated predictive models that may incorporate nonlinearity in classification. Other graph based models, like graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) would also be interesting to look at, though may be limited by the dataset size.  

We hope to expand our work to get better predictive and analytical results. Given good results with the GCN, we hope to try different parameter values. A main hindrance to the training was tuning the learning rate. We hope to test different optimizers for better learning rate tuning (Adam for example). 

We also want to expand the graph structures. As of now, we only considered the simple graph structure. In the future we hope to consider the complex structure with the opponent added. Additionally, we want to consider the averaged structure that is based on a seasonâ€™s worth of games.
