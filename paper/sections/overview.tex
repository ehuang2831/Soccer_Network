\tu{Principal Contributions}:
To our knowledge, predicting soccer game outcome from play-by-play data using a passing rate graph and feature embeddings such as node2vec and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has never been done before.
A principal contribution of our project is to use hard-to-obtain, high quality play-by-play data
to compare the predictive power of simple features with those based on random walk simulations and deep learning.

\tu{Paper organization}:
The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In particular, our overall soccer graph analysis pipeline is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram}.
