We wish to be graded equally since we believe
our contributions were equal. Evan Huang did part of this work for CS221 and did a majority of the 
Graph CNN analysis, but due to the extensive computation time (~4 hours per run) and need
for custom-coded random walk features discussed in CS224W, we want part of this analysis to count for CS224W as well.
