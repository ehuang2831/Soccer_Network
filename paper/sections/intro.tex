Given the natural existence of networks in team-based sports, we hope to use network analysis and predictive modeling to better analyze soccer. Currently, research in soccer analytics has focused on individual player statistics, and predictive modeling has been limited to simple logistic regression, decision trees, and LSTMs [3]. We believe that leveraging network structure will create better results given the importance of teamwork within the sport. In particular, a better predictive model can benefit both the sports betting industry (last year, the total betting on sport was \$4.9 billion in Nevada alone [1]) and the soccer team's management.
