\tu{Principal Contributions}:
To our knowledge, predicting soccer game outcome from play-by-play data using a passing rate graph and feature embeddings such as node2vec and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has never been done before.
A principal contribution of our project is to use hard-to-obtain, high quality play-by-play data
to compare the predictive power of simple features with those based on random walk simulations and deep learning.

\tu{Paper organization}:
The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In particular, our overall soccer graph analysis pipeline is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram}:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Graph Creation}:

We describe our data sanitization and graph creation process in Section \ref{sec:dataset}, with an example graph in Figure \ref{fig:example_graph} and basic dataset statisics in Figure \ref{fig:per_player_goal_distro}.

\item \textbf{Node Feature Embeddings:}
In Section \ref{sec:graph_analysis}, we introduce a variety of techniques to learn key features of nodes that are used to predict game outcome, summarized in the overall results table of Figure \ref{fig:results_table}. We also investigate whether these features are discriminative enough to cluster games using t-SNE by either game outcome (Figure \ref{fig:tsne_game}) or team identity (Figure \ref{fig:tsne_team}).

\item \textbf{Graph Convolutional Neural Network:}
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:graph_GCN}, we use a custom random-walk procedure to learn node embeddings using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) that are the best-performing on game outcome prediction.
