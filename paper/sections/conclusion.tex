Rich network structure is inherent to the team game of soccer, which
manifests as time-variant passing rates between players of a team,
and possession changes between opposing teams. Using network structure to predict
game outcomes and learn latent features representing player roles is of prime importance,
since it can help coaches better understand their teams and aid in the large sports
analytics and betting market.

In this paper, we provided a principled analysis of play-by-player soccer
data, starting from graph extraction and using a mixture of domain knowledge and 
unsupervised feature learning to predict game outcomes. As expected, given the
dynamic, unpredictable nature of soccer games, we could not create a highly-accurate
game outcome predictor. Interestingly though, our results illustrate a marked increase
in predictive power if we use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) even with a limited
dataset compared to conventional techniques.
